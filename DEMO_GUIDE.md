# Virtual Land Registry Demo Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This is a **Virtual Land Registry dApp** built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that enables users to:
- Register virtual land parcels
- Buy and sell land in a decentralized marketplace
- Manage virtual wallets with ICP tokens
- Transfer ownership transparently on the blockchain

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Internet Identity integration
- **Land Registration**: Register new virtual land parcels with coordinates, size, and metadata
- **Marketplace**: Buy and sell land with real wallet transactions
- **Wallet System**: Virtual wallet with ICP token support (e8s format)
- **Ownership Transfer**: Transparent ownership transfers recorded on blockchain
- **Land Verification**: Verification system for land parcels

### âœ… Technical Features
- **Backend**: Rust canisters with stable storage
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Stable BTreeMap for persistent data
- **Smart Contracts**: Internet Computer canisters for business logic
- **Security**: Principal-based authentication and ownership verification

## ðŸ›  How to Run the Demo in your System

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure DFX is running
dfx start --background --clean

# Deploy all canisters
dfx deploy
```

### Demo Steps

#### 1. **Open the Application**
- Navigate to: http://uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai.localhost:8000/

- Click "Initialize" under Wallet Balance to get 500 ICP starting balance
- You can also click "Add Funds" to add more ICP for testing

#### 3. **Explore Your Dashboard**
- View your wallet balance (should show 500.00 ICP after initialization)
- See your land count and verified lands
- View platform statistics

#### 4. **Marketplace Demo**
- Go to "Marketplace" section
- You'll see lands for sale from other mock users
- Your wallet balance is displayed in the top-right
- **Try to buy a land**:
  - Click "Buy Now" on any available land

#### 6. **Register New Land**
- Go to "Register Land" section
- Fill in the form:
  - Coordinates: e.g., "48.8566, 2.3522" (Paris)
  - Size: e.g., 1500 (square units)
  - Description: e.g., "Premium virtual space in digital Paris"
  - Metadata: e.g., "Commercial zoning, high traffic"
- Submit to register new land

## ðŸ’° Wallet System Details

### Initial Balance
- New users get **500 ICP** (50,000,000,000 e8s) when initializing their wallet
- 1 ICP = 100,000,000 e8s (smallest unit)

### Demo Funds
- Use "Add Funds" button to add more ICP for testing
- Sample lands are priced between 50-75 ICP for demo purposes

### Transaction Flow
1. User purchases land â†’ ICP deducted from buyer's wallet
2. ICP credited to seller's wallet
3. Land ownership transfers to buyer
4. Transaction recorded in land history

## ðŸ”§ Backend API Testing

You can also test backend functions directly via DFX CLI:

```bash
# Check wallet balance
dfx canister call asset_canister get_wallet_balance '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL")'

# Initialize wallet
dfx canister call asset_canister initialize_user_wallet

# Get lands for sale
dfx canister call asset_canister get_lands_for_sale

# Buy land (ID 2)
dfx canister call asset_canister buy_land '(2)'

# Get user's lands
dfx canister call asset_canister get_user_lands '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL")'
```

## ðŸ“Š Demo Scenario Walkthrough

### Scenario: Complete Land Transaction
1. **Setup**: Initialize wallet with 500 ICP
2. **Browse**: View available lands in marketplace
3. **Purchase**: Buy a 50 ICP land (balance becomes 450 ICP)
4. **Sell**: List your land for 75 ICP
5. **Verify**: Check transaction history and ownership transfer

### Key Demo Points to Highlight
