# üöÄ How to Restart DFX Without Losing Data

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Do NOT use `dfx start --clean`

Using `dfx start --clean` will wipe ALL your data and create new canister IDs, which will break your app!

## ‚úÖ Correct Way to Restart DFX

### To restart DFX while preserving data:

```bash
# Stop DFX
dfx stop

# Start DFX (without --clean flag)
dfx start --background

# If you need to redeploy after making changes:
dfx deploy
```

### To completely reset and start fresh (‚ö†Ô∏è This will lose all data):

```bash
# Stop DFX
dfx stop

# Start fresh (this creates new canister IDs)
dfx start --clean --background

# Deploy all canisters
dfx deploy

# Update .env file with new canister IDs
# You'll need to copy the new canister IDs from the deploy output into frontend/.env
```

## üîß Current Canister IDs

Your current canister IDs are:
- **Asset Canister (Land Registry)**: `uxrrr-q7777-77774-qaaaq-cai`
- **Auth Canister**: `u6s2n-gx777-77774-qaaba-cai`
- **Marketplace Canister**: `ulvla-h7777-77774-qaacq-cai`
- **Internet Identity**: `umunu-kh777-77774-qaaca-cai`
- **Frontend**: `uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai`

## üåê App URLs

- **Frontend App**: http://uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai.localhost:8000/
- **Internet Identity**: http://umunu-kh777-77774-qaaca-cai.localhost:8000/

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Persistence

The app uses **stable storage** which means:
- ‚úÖ Your land data persists across normal restarts
- ‚úÖ Authentication works correctly
- ‚úÖ No need to re-register lands

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If you see "Canister not found" errors:
1. Check that DFX is running: `dfx ping`
2. Verify canister IDs match between `.env` file and deployed canisters
3. Redeploy if needed: `dfx deploy`

### If authentication doesn't work:
1. Clear browser cache for localhost:8000
2. Make sure Internet Identity canister is deployed
3. Check that the correct Internet Identity URL is being used

### If you accidentally used `--clean`:
1. Update the canister IDs in `frontend/.env` with the new ones from deploy output
2. Rebuild and redeploy: `dfx deploy`
3. Use the "Create Sample Lands" button in the "My Lands" section to add demo data


# Virtual Land Registry Demo Guide

## üéØ Project Overview
This is a **Virtual Land Registry dApp** built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that enables users to:

- **User Authentication**: Internet Identity integration
- **Land Registration**: Register new virtual land parcels with coordinates, size, and metadata
- **Marketplace**: Buy and sell land with real wallet transactions
- **Wallet System**: Virtual wallet with ICP token support (e8s format)
- **Ownership Transfer**: Transparent ownership transfers recorded on blockchain
- **Land Verification**: Verification system for land parcels

### ‚úÖ Technical Features
- **Backend**: Rust canisters with stable storage
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Stable BTreeMap for persistent data
- **Smart Contracts**: Internet Computer canisters for business logic
- **Security**: Principal-based authentication and ownership verification

## üõ† How to Run the Demo in your System

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure DFX is running
dfx start --background --clean

# Deploy all canisters
dfx deploy
```

### Demo Steps

#### 1. **Open the Application**
- Navigate to: http://uzt4z-lp777-77774-qaabq-cai.localhost:8000/
- Click "Login" and authenticate with Internet Identity

#### 2. **Initialize Sample Data & Wallet**
- Go to Dashboard
- Click "Create Sample Data" to populate demo lands
- Click "Initialize" under Wallet Balance to get 500 ICP starting balance
- You can also click "Add Funds" to add more ICP for testing

#### 3. **Explore Your Dashboard**
- View your wallet balance (should show 500.00 ICP after initialization)
- See your land count and verified lands
- View platform statistics

#### 4. **Marketplace Demo**
- Go to "Marketplace" section
- You'll see lands for sale from other mock users
- Your wallet balance is displayed in the top-right
- **Try to buy a land**:
  - Click "Buy Now" on any available land
  - Confirm the purchase in the popup
  - Your wallet balance will be deducted
  - Land ownership transfers to you

#### 5. **My Lands Management**
- Go to "My Lands" section
- View all lands you own
- **List land for sale**:
  - Click "Set for Sale" on any land you own
  - Enter a price in ICP (e.g., 25.50)
  - The land will appear in the marketplace

#### 6. **Register New Land**
- Go to "Register Land" section
- Fill in the form:
  - Coordinates: e.g., "48.8566, 2.3522" (Paris)
  - Size: e.g., 1500 (square units)
  - Description: e.g., "Premium virtual space in digital Paris"
  - Metadata: e.g., "Commercial zoning, high traffic"
- Submit to register new land

## üí∞ Wallet System Details

### Initial Balance
- New users get **500 ICP** (50,000,000,000 e8s) when initializing their wallet
- 1 ICP = 100,000,000 e8s (smallest unit)

## üí∞ Wallet System Details

### Initial Balance
- New users get **500 ICP** (50,000,000,000 e8s) when initializing their wallet
- 1 ICP = 100,000,000 e8s (smallest unit)

### Demo Funds
- Use "Add Funds" button to add more ICP for testing
- Sample lands are priced between 50-75 ICP for demo purposes

### Transaction Flow
1. User purchases land ‚Üí ICP deducted from buyer's wallet
2. ICP credited to seller's wallet
3. Land ownership transfers to buyer
4. Transaction recorded in land history

## üîß Backend API Testing

You can also test backend functions directly via DFX CLI:

```bash
# Check wallet balance
dfx canister call asset_canister get_wallet_balance '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL")'

# Initialize wallet
dfx canister call asset_canister initialize_user_wallet

# Get lands for sale
dfx canister call asset_canister get_lands_for_sale

# Buy land (ID 2)
dfx canister call asset_canister buy_land '(2)'

# Get user's lands
dfx canister call asset_canister get_user_lands '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL")'
```

  - Enter a price in ICP (e.g., 25.50)
  - The land will appear in the marketplace

#### 6. **Register New Land**
- Go to "Register Land" section
- Fill in the form:
  - Coordinates: e.g., "48.8566, 2.3522" (Paris)
  - Size: e.g., 1500 (square units)
  - Description: e.g., "Premium virtual space in digital Paris"
  - Metadata: e.g., "Commercial zoning, high traffic"
- Submit to register new land

## üí∞ Wallet System Details

### Initial Balance
- New users get **500 ICP** (50,000,000,000 e8s) when initializing their wallet
- 1 ICP = 100,000,000 e8s (smallest unit)

### Demo Funds
- Use "Add Funds" button to add more ICP for testing
- Sample lands are priced between 50-75 ICP for demo purposes

### Transaction Flow
1. User purchases land ‚Üí ICP deducted from buyer's wallet
2. ICP credited to seller's wallet
3. Land ownership transfers to buyer
4. Transaction recorded in land history

## üîß Backend API Testing

You can also test backend functions directly via DFX CLI:

```bash
# Check wallet balance
dfx canister call asset_canister get_wallet_balance '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL")'

# Initialize wallet
dfx canister call asset_canister initialize_user_wallet

# Get lands for sale
dfx canister call asset_canister get_lands_for_sale

# Buy land (ID 2)
dfx canister call asset_canister buy_land '(2)'

# Get user's lands
dfx canister call asset_canister get_user_lands '(principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL")'
```

## üìä Demo Scenario Walkthrough

### Scenario: Complete Land Transaction
1. **Setup**: Initialize wallet with 500 ICP
2. **Browse**: View available lands in marketplace
3. **Purchase**: Buy a 50 ICP land (balance becomes 450 ICP)
4. **Sell**: List your land for 75 ICP
5. **Verify**: Check transaction history and ownership transfer

### Key Demo Points to Highlight
